# Algorithms

Repo with all kinds of known algorithms implemented in different programming languages. For didactic purposes.

## How is structured?

Differents kinds of algorithms are separated in sections (folders) so it's easier to find the one you are looking for.

Inside of each folder there is a folder with the name of a programming lenguage, meaning that the same algorithm is implemented in different lenguages.

Notice that not all of them are implented in all lenguages.

## Sections:

**_/misc_** -> Diverse algorithms, mixture of algorithms with varied purposes.
 
**_/search_** -> Algorithms for searching data in different types of data structures.
