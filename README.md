## How is structured?

Differents kinds of algorithms are separated in sections (folders) so it's easier to find the one you are looking for.

Inside of each folder there is a folder with the name of a programming lenguage, meaning that the same algorithm is implemented in different lenguages.

Notice that not all of them are implented in all the lenguages.

## Sections:

**_/misc_** -> Miscelania algorithms
/search -> Searching algorithms
